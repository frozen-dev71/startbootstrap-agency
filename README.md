# Agency by Start Bootstrap [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/IronSummitMedia/startbootstrap-agency.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/IronSummitMedia/startbootstrap-agency)

Agency is a one page HTML theme for agencies created by Start Bootstrap. This repository is a pre-release that we are using to test integrating themes with Grunt, Bower, and ultimately, creating Yeoman and Brunch scaffolds for all of our open source templates and themes.

To access the current version of this template, visit http://startbootstrap.com/template-overviews/agency/.

## Installation

- Fork the source files from this repository.
- Run `npm install` in the root directory to install Grunt dependencies.
- Run `bower install` in the root directory to install Bower dependencies.

You are now ready to work with the theme! Feel free to edit the Gruntfile as you see fit. It's recommended that you have a working knowledge of Grunt and Bower before attempting to use these source files. If you want the easy to use, HTML/CSS version of this template, you can download it at http://startbootstrap.com/template-overviews/agency/.

## Grunt Tasks

- `grunt` will run all Grunt tasks. It will build the dist folder based on the specifications set up in the Gruntfile.
- `grunt watch` will watch specified files for changes, and automatically build them within the dist folder.

## Support

If you have questions about the theme you can submit an issue here on GitHub or you can leave a comment on the theme overview page on Start Bootstrap at http://startbootstrap.com/template-overviews/agency/.

## Contributing

If you have fixed a bug with the template feel free to open a pull request and I will review and merge the request.

*NOTE: Pull requests with new features will most likely not be added to the base theme! The templates and themes on Start Bootstrap are meant to be starting points for people to work off of, and I don't typically add any new feature unless they are frequently asked for.*

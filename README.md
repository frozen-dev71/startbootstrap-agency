# Agency by Start Bootstrap

Agency is a one page HTML theme for agencies created by Start Bootstrap. This repository is a pre-release that we are using to test integrating themes with Grunt, Bower, and ultimately, creating Yeoman and Brunch scaffolds for all of our open source templates and themes.

To access the current version of this template, visit http://startbootstrap.com/template-overviews/agency/.

## Using these Source Files

You can use the source files within this repo to customize the Agency theme. You can custmoize the HTML, CSS (using LESS), and the JavaScript while Grunt watches the files and compiles them automatically for you. To get started, follow the steps below.

- Clone the repo
- Run `npm install` in the root directory
- After all of the node modules are installed you can either edit files and then run `grunt` to build the new dist folder, or you can run `grunt watch` which will tell Grunt to watch specified files for changes, and update the files in the dist folder automatically.

*Note: You will need to have Node Package Manager (npm) and Grunt installed in order to perform the tasks outlined above.*

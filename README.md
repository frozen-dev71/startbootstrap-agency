# Agency by Start Bootstrap [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/IronSummitMedia/startbootstrap-agency.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/IronSummitMedia/startbootstrap-agency)

Agency is a one page HTML theme for agencies created by Start Bootstrap. This repository is a pre-release that we are using to test integrating themes with Grunt, Bower, and ultimately, creating Yeoman and Brunch scaffolds for all of our open source templates and themes.

To access the current version of this template, visit http://startbootstrap.com/template-overviews/agency/.

## Using these Source Files

You can use the source files within this repo to customize the Agency theme. You can custmoize the HTML, CSS (using LESS), and the JavaScript while Grunt watches the files and compiles them automatically for you. To get started, follow the steps below.

- First, clone the repository.
- Run `npm install` in the root directory to install all of the Grunt dependencies.
- Run `grunt` after all of the node modules are installed to test the Grunt tasks and to install the required Bower components.

## Grunt Tasks

- `grunt` will run all Grunt tasks. It will build the dist folder and it will install Bower components.
- `grunt watch` will watch specified files for changes, and automatically build them within the dist folder.
- `grunt build` will build the dist folder, but will not install Bower components.

*Note: You will need to have Node Package Manager (npm) and Grunt installed in order to perform the tasks outlined above.*
